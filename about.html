            <font color="#6D6D6D" size="5" >I am a <strong>second-year Information Technology student</strong> and future web and app developer, I possess strong technical skills<br />
            and am fascinated by the workings of technology behind the screen. Being a college student, I am naturally curious and enjoy learning 
            and adapting to change. Failures have shown me that there is always room for <u>improvement and growth</u> in my skills, which will 
            enable me to improve in the future. My passion for technology has driven me to pursue this major, and I am excited about  
            the prospect of developing software and applications that can engage and empower others through the use of technology.</p>
